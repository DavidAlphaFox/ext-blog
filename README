INSTALL

The good news is, ext-blog is in quicklisp software list, so you can install
ext-blog by quicklisp:

    (ql:quickload 'ext-blog)

Also, I still show you how to install ext-blog without quicklisp.  I will use 
SBCL to illustrate. And ext-blog depends on some third-party lisp libraries, so
I suggest you to use quick lisp to install these libraries. 

When you download ext-blog full source codes, go to ext-blog root directory, 
and run SBCL, i.e:

    cd ext-blog
    SBCL

And if you're the first time to load ext-blog, you can load dep.lisp to intall
these third-party libraries by quick lisp first, i.e:

    (load "dep.lisp")

And if you already have installed quick lisp, it will download some libraries 
first.

After that, everything is ready. You can load ext-blog by asdf, i.e:

    (asdf:load-system :ext-blog)

Sometimes asdf display an error like you do not have access to create a file, 
If so, you can run SBCL as root.

After that, you can run ext-blog now, i.e:

    (ext-blog:start)

ext-blog will launch a web server using hunchentoot at port 8000. So you can 
visit it to test:

    http://localhost:8000

If you're the first time to run ext-blog, there's no data files for your blog,
so you will be indirected to initializing page to setup your blog. The setup 
page only needs admin user name and password.

After that, everytime you want to launch ext-blog, you can only load it in SBCL
 and start it, i.e:

    (asdf:load-system :ext-blog)
    (ext-blog:start)
